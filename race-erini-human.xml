      <p>The people of Erinos are human. Nearly all adults stand over six feet tall, and heights above seven feet are not uncommon. They are massively muscled and have gray skin, ranging from an ashy gray-white to a deeper bluegray. The typical Erini’s hairline points sharply down in the middle of the forehead and at either temple, but recedes elsewhere—sometimes dramatically. Erinis are remarkably resistant to the cold of their homeland, baring skin even in near-freezing temperatures without discomfort.</p>
      <p>Erinis value self-reliance, strength, and courage above all else. Anything that is the product of their own labor is a fine thing. Anything else is treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. At best, they are a proud, pragmatic, passionate people, and their loyalty is fierce once earned. At worst, they can be reckless, hot-tempered, and violent—and no small number of Erinis still consider these qualities virtues rather than vices.</p>
      <p>Because of their many exploits as both conquerors and mercenaries, Erinis appear in the legends and histories of other peoples across the world. Sometimes these tales are exaggerated—but many that sound exaggerated are not.</p>
